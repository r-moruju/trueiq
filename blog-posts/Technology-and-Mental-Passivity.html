    <p>In a world where artificial intelligence can write our essays, suggest our next meal, and even predict our moods,
      one question looms large: <strong>Is technology making us mentally passive?</strong></p>

    <p>Convenience has always been a driving force in human innovation. But today, the tools that simplify our lives
      might also be subtly dulling the very muscles that made us innovators to begin with — our minds.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">🤖 Automation vs. Active Thinking</h2>

    <section class="my-10">
      <figure class="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
        <img src="../assets/ai-brain-warning.png" alt="Human and AI brain comparison with mental passivity warning"
          class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full h-auto" loading="lazy" />
        <figcaption class="mt-2 text-sm text-center text-gray-500 italic">

    </section>

    <p>There was a time when solving a math problem or researching an idea required effort — flipping pages,
      synthesizing sources, thinking critically. Now, with a few taps, answers are instant. That’s efficient, yes — but
      also mentally numbing when overused.</p>

    <p>Apps finish our thoughts, autocomplete our questions, and suggest what to think about next. What’s slowly eroding
      isn't just memory — it's <em>mental initiative</em>.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">🧠 The Evolutionary Power of Questioning</h2>
    <p>Human evolution isn’t just physical — it's cognitive. Our progress as a species came from asking difficult
      questions:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
      <li>“What lies beyond the stars?”</li>
      <li>“Why do we get sick?”</li>
      <li>“Can I make fire?”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every breakthrough — from science to civilization — began not with an answer, but a <strong>question</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>The danger of offloading too much mental effort to machines is that we lose the instinct to ask those questions
      ourselves.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">📉 The Long-Term Risks</h2>
    <p>Relying heavily on AI and automation without mindfulness can lead to:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
      <li><strong>Cognitive atrophy:</strong> Reduced memory, attention span, and problem-solving ability</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional detachment:</strong> Less reflection, empathy, and human perspective</li>
      <li><strong>Decreased innovation:</strong> Fewer original ideas due to lack of mental struggle</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If we don’t exercise our intellectual faculties, evolution won’t wait for us — it may just pass us by.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">🔄 How to Stay Mentally Active in an AI World</h2>

    <p>Technology is not the enemy. It's how we use it that matters. Here’s how to keep your brain evolving:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
      <li><strong>Question everything:</strong> Ask “why?” before accepting what AI tells you.</li>
      <li><strong>Delay gratification:</strong> Try solving something yourself before Googling it.</li>
      <li><strong>Engage in debates:</strong> Healthy disagreement stimulates neural pathways.</li>
      <li><strong>Read deeply:</strong> Go beyond summaries. Engage with complex material.</li>
      <li><strong>Create regularly:</strong> Write, build, draw, code — output matters more than input.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">🌍 The Future Belongs to the Mentally Engaged</h2>
    <p>We are entering a world where machines can mimic intelligence. But they cannot yet mimic <em>wisdom</em>,
      <em>imagination</em>, or <em>curiosity</em>. Those are still uniquely human traits — and they are worth
      protecting.
    </p>

    <p>As AI handles more of the “doing,” it’s up to us to preserve the “thinking.” Because the future of human
      evolution won’t be defined by what machines can do — but by what we refuse to stop doing ourselves.</p>
