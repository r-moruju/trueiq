    <p>What do Albert Einstein, Marilyn vos Savant, and Stephen Hawking have in common? Besides shaping history in their own ways, they’re all recognized for having extraordinarily high IQs — well above the average range.</p>

    <p>But intelligence is more than just a number. These individuals also displayed unique patterns of thought, problem-solving habits, and mental resilience that we can learn from — regardless of our own IQ score.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">🌟 Marilyn vos Savant – The Logic Queen</h2>
    <p>With an IQ estimated between <strong>228–230</strong>, Marilyn vos Savant was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the woman with the highest IQ. She gained fame for solving complex logic puzzles in her magazine column and for <em>debunking flawed reasoning</em> — even from academics.</p>
    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Clear thinking and structured logic often trump raw data. Practice explaining complex ideas in simple terms — it’s a true sign of mastery.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">⚛️ Albert Einstein – The Rule Breaker</h2>
    <p>Though never formally tested, Einstein is estimated to have had an IQ around <strong>160</strong>. He wasn’t a straight-A student — he challenged conventions, questioned textbooks, and visualized theories in ways that seemed unorthodox. His theory of relativity forever changed physics.</p>
    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Intelligence isn’t obedience. It’s the courage to question norms, follow curiosity, and trust unconventional paths.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">🪐 Stephen Hawking – The Cosmic Thinker</h2>
    <p>Despite being diagnosed with ALS in his early 20s, Stephen Hawking went on to revolutionize theoretical physics with insights on black holes and cosmology. IQ estimates put him around <strong>160–170</strong>, but his impact came from <strong>relentless focus</strong> and an ability to simplify incredibly complex ideas.</p>
    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Resilience and focus amplify intelligence. Even under constraint, a sharp mind can change the world.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">🎭 Leonardo da Vinci – The Polymath</h2>
    <p>Estimated IQ: <strong>180–190</strong>. Leonardo wasn’t just a painter — he was an inventor, anatomist, architect, and philosopher. He documented thousands of pages of observations, sketches, and mechanical ideas, often centuries ahead of his time.</p>
    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Intellectual curiosity across disciplines leads to greater innovation. Explore widely, think deeply.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">🔍 What All These Geniuses Have in Common</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
      <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> They asked “why?” more than most people.</li>
      <li><strong>Pattern Thinking:</strong> They saw systems, not just facts.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk Tolerance:</strong> They challenged assumptions.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Deep work led to breakthrough thinking.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You don’t need a genius IQ to think like one. The habits of high-IQ individuals — questioning, reflecting, simplifying — are available to everyone with intention and practice.</p>
