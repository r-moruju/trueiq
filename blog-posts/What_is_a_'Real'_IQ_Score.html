    <p>“What’s your IQ?” It’s a question tossed around in classrooms, on job forums, or even in casual chats. But what does that number actually mean — and more importantly, <strong>is it real</strong>? With the rise of online quizzes claiming to measure genius, it's time we separated fact from fiction about IQ scores.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">📏 The Basics: What Does an IQ Score Represent?</h2>
    <p><strong>IQ</strong> (Intelligence Quotient) is a standardized score designed to assess a person’s cognitive abilities relative to the general population. The average score is <strong>100</strong>. About 68% of people score between 85 and 115. IQ tests typically measure:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
      <li>Logical reasoning</li>
      <li>Pattern recognition</li>
      <li>Verbal understanding</li>
      <li>Spatial awareness</li>
      <li>Working memory</li>
    </ul>

    <p>True IQ tests are developed using rigorous psychometric standards — not just a few fun trivia questions.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">🧪 What Makes an IQ Score “Real”?</h2>
    <p>A “real” IQ score has these core traits:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
      <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Tests include a timer to assess both speed and accuracy</li>
      <li><strong>Variety:</strong> Questions cover multiple categories of cognition</li>
      <li><strong>Norm-referenced:</strong> Your score is compared to a validated population sample</li>
      <li><strong>Weighted scoring:</strong> Different sections carry different impacts on the final result</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>BrainPulseIQ</strong> integrates all of these — blending question difficulty, response speed, and cognitive range to provide scores rooted in science, not guesswork.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">🚫 4 Common Myths About IQ Scores</h2>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">1. “Your IQ never changes.”</h3>
    <p>Wrong. IQ is influenced by environment, education, stress, sleep, and even nutrition. Neuroplasticity means your brain can evolve — and so can your score.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">2. “Online quizzes are accurate.”</h3>
    <p>Unless the quiz uses time pressure, adaptive question logic, and a broad category spread, it’s likely just entertainment.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">3. “IQ measures everything that matters.”</h3>
    <p>Nope. IQ measures <em>specific</em> mental skills, but not creativity, emotional intelligence, or social abilities — all vital in life and work.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">4. “High IQ = Success in Life.”</h3>
    <p>Not always. Motivation, discipline, and emotional intelligence often outweigh raw IQ in long-term achievement.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">🧠 How BrainPulseIQ Approaches “Real” IQ</h2>

      <li><strong>Weighted scoring</strong> by category & difficulty</li>
      <li><strong>Performance breakdowns</strong> for learning insights</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With each test, you get not just a number, but a reflection of how your brain thinks and reacts.</p>
